@Injectable - This decorator shows that the class can be injected.
Dependency can be provided in follwing ways - 

1. At the application root level using providedIn

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})

class HeroService {}

It allows injecting the service into all other classes.
*** When you provide the service at the root level, Angular creates a single, shared instance of the HeroService and injects it into any class that asks for it.
